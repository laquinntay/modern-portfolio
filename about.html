            My name is Quinn McCarthy and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I've
            dived right in to learning coding and I am astounded at the endless
            possibilities that are possible in this world! I'm looking forward
            to soaking up as much knowledge as I can and putting my creative
            vision out into the world.

          <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
          <h6>HTML, Sass, JavaScript</h6>
          <p>
            This website is actually one of the first projects I ever did!
            Building this taught me a lot about the different methods used in
            HTML and CSS and was also my first experience with Sass, the CSS
            compiler!

          <p>
            The next task that I want to take on is a basic snake game. I know
            that this is a relatively low-level project, but I feel like it
            would be a nice change of pace from building websites all day and
            would allow me to showcase a different set of skills.

          <h6>TBD</h6>
          <p>
            I want to create projects that are useful in today's modern world
            that also allow me to showcase my abilities. A debugger is something
            that a lot of people use (since bugs are so prevalent) and learning
            how to build one from scratch will teach me a lot about how code
            interacts with itself and how to solve some bugs myself.
